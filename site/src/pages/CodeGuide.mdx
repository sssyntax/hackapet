# Code guide

### Preface

In this tutorial, I'll be going through how I made my game, step by step - this assumes you have art assets (even if they're just wips) ready. 

I'm going to assume you have CircuitPython and displayio and everything set up already. If not, go back to [setup](https://hackapet.hackclub.com/setup) and get that done first!

This tutorial also assumes that you're already familiar with basic Python syntax - if not, [w3schools guide](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp) is a good place to start. Note that unlike other common languages, line indentation matters in Python!

Finally, note that I do expect something new in your game! Even though this is a tutorial, it's just the basics - you must add in something more for your game to count.

### Part 1: Getting things to show up

Firstly, I'm going to import a few libraries that our code relies on. 

```python
import displayio
from blinka_displayio_pygamedisplay import PyGameDisplay
import pygame
import time
```

`displayio` is what CircuitPython uses to display things to hardware screens. `blinka_displayio_pygamedisplay` and `pygame` are used to get it displaying in a window on your computer. 

Next, we're going to initialize Pygame and the display. 

```python
pygame.init()
display = PyGameDisplay(width=128, height=128)
splash = displayio.Group()
display.show(splash)
```

The OLED screen is 128x128 pixels, thus the width and height being set to that. `splash` is what we're calling the `Group` that the display will show. Read more about display/group/tilegrid nesting [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-display-support-using-displayio/library-overview). 

Now, we're going to add in the background! I have a .bmp file called `forestbackground.bmp`, located in the same folder, which we'll be displaying.

```python
forest_background = displayio.OnDiskBitmap("forestbackground.bmp")

bg_sprite = displayio.TileGrid(
	forest_background, 
	pixel_shader=forest_background.pixel_shader
)

splash.append(bg_sprite)
```

The first line defines a variable as the image. The second part gives specifications -  for a background, we only really need to specify the sprite and the shader used. The final line is the one that makes it display on screen.

After that, let's get the cat (my pet) displayed too! Note that my cat is animated; the .bmp file is 9 different frames in one.

```python
cat_sheet = displayio.OnDiskBitmap("cat-Sheet.bmp")

cat_sprite = displayio.TileGrid(
	cat_sheet,
	pixel_shader=cat_sheet.pixel_shader,
	width=1,
	height=1,
	tile_width=32,
	tile_height=32,
	default_tile=0,
	x=(display.width - tile_width) // 2,
	y=display.height - tile_height - 10
)

splash.append(cat_sprite)
```

It's similar to displaying the forest background, but notice how we defined many more things within the cat sprite this time around. We'll be using these later - the tile sizes are used for anything relating to size (ie: collision), `default_tile` refers to the frame it starts on, and `x` and `y` define where the sprite rests on the screen. 

Now, we just need a basic gameplay loop before running it.

```python
frame = 0

while True:

	for event in pygame.event.get():
		if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
		pygame.quit()
		exit()
	
	cat_sprite[0] = frame
    frame = (frame + 1) % (cat_sheet.width // tile_width)

	time.sleep(0.01)
```

All this does is check if the player hits the red "x" to quit - if so, the program closes. It runs this loop once every 0.01 seconds.

Now, if we run the game, a small window should appear! 

### Part 2: Making the cat move

To do this, we'll need to use Pygame to take in button input. We need to also be constantly checking whether it's pressed, so let's put it into the loop.

```python

keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

if game_over == False:
	if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
		cat_sprite.x -= speed
	if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
		cat_sprite.x += speed

```

This code checks if the left or right arrow keys are pressed, and moves the cat accordingly.

### Part 3: Fireballs, death screen, and everything else!!

In my game, I'll have fireballs that rain down that the cat has to dodge. *(based off that one animal jam minigame i loved when i was 9 haha)*

I'll also add in a function that detects collisions, and also a death screen when things do collide. 

The final game code looks like this!

```python
import displayio
from blinka_displayio_pygamedisplay import PyGameDisplay
import pygame
import time
from adafruit_display_text import label
import random

pygame.init()

display = PyGameDisplay(width=128, height=128)
splash = displayio.Group()
display.show(splash)

forest_background = displayio.OnDiskBitmap("forestbackground.bmp")
bg_sprite = displayio.TileGrid(forest_background, pixel_shader=forest_background.pixel_shader)
splash.append(bg_sprite)

cat_sheet = displayio.OnDiskBitmap("cat-Sheet.bmp")

tile_width = 32
tile_height = 32

cat_sprite = displayio.TileGrid(
    cat_sheet,
    pixel_shader=cat_sheet.pixel_shader,
    width=1,
    height=1,
    tile_width=tile_width,
    tile_height=tile_height,
    default_tile=0,
    x=(display.width - tile_width) // 2,  
    y=display.height - tile_height - 10     
)

splash.append(cat_sprite)

fireball_bitmap = displayio.OnDiskBitmap("fireball.bmp")

fireballs = []

def spawn_fireball():
    x_position = random.randint(0, display.width - fireball_bitmap.width)
    fireball = displayio.TileGrid(
        fireball_bitmap,
        pixel_shader=fireball_bitmap.pixel_shader,
        width=1,
        height=1,
        tile_width=fireball_bitmap.width,
        tile_height=fireball_bitmap.height,
        x=x_position,
        y=-32
    )
    fireballs.append(fireball)
    splash.append(fireball)

# Function to check for collisions
def check_collision(sprite1, sprite2):
    return (
        sprite1.x < sprite2.x + 32 and
        sprite1.x + 32 > sprite2.x and
        sprite1.y < sprite2.y + 32 and
        sprite1.y + 32 > sprite2.y
    )

death = displayio.OnDiskBitmap("restart.bmp")

def display_game_over():
    global death_hi
    death_hi = displayio.TileGrid(
        death,
        pixel_shader=cat_sheet.pixel_shader,
        width=1,
        height=1,
        tile_width=64,
        tile_height=32,
        default_tile=0,
        x=(display.width - 64) // 2,  
        y=(display.height - 32) // 2  
    )
    splash.append(death_hi)
    for i in fireballs:
        splash.remove(i)
    fireballs.clear()

frame = 0
speed = 4 
game_over = False

while True:

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP and game_over == True:
                for i in fireballs:
                    splash.remove(i)
                fireballs.clear()
                splash.remove(death_hi)
                game_over = False


    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    if game_over == False:
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            cat_sprite.x -= speed
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            cat_sprite.x += speed
        if random.random() < 0.05:  # spawn rate
            spawn_fireball()

    for fireball in fireballs:
        fireball.y += 5 
        if fireball.y > display.height:
            splash.remove(fireball)
            fireballs.remove(fireball)
        elif check_collision(cat_sprite, fireball):
            game_over = True
            display_game_over()

    cat_sprite[0] = frame
    frame = (frame + 1) % (cat_sheet.width // tile_width)

    time.sleep(0.1)
```
